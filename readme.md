This is currently a very basic implementation of an Entity Component System in Python.  It is very early and may change significantly.  Check it out and file issues with your feedback!

- Requires Python 3.4
- Designed to be general purpose, but especially for use as the Entity Component System in the Adhara Engine, the game engine that will power the MMO game Adhara.
- Stores Assemblages, Entities, Components and data about Systems in the Adhara DB graph database
- Contributions welcome- see below!

#Road Map#
- Documentation :)
- More, better unit tests


#Contributing#
- All code is Apache 2 licensed
- Currently this library is in its infancy.  Please open an issue before you begin work on any contributions so that we can properly plan together and save a ton of potentially wasted time :)

#Usage#
I really should write some documentation here :)
